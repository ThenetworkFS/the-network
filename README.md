# The Network

The Network is a professional networking website built for alumni of Fullstack Academy of Code.

## Motivation

We decided to build The Network to address concerns from students at Fullstack Academy that there wasn't a great way to keep in touch with classmates and connect with other alumni. We created The Network to provide a place for the Fullstack Academy community to connect and learn from each other.

## Main Features

* Users can sign up/sign in using Google OAuth.
* Users can download the app as a Progressive Web App and access some content and functionality offline
* Users can view, post and search in a feed of job postings, news, forum and meetups. Links and code snippets are automatically formatted.
* Users can view the profiles of other alumni, with links to their github and LinkedIn profiles.
* Users can search and filter alumni by location, company, and Fullstack Academt cohort, and view alumni on a map.
